building model that has hyperparameter like regresion Lasso model in sklearn,
we can't track the performance history of different hyperparameter.

MLFlow can track model performance history.

____________

- Experiment Tracker
    - provide the information track of the model
- Model Registry
    - model(s) will be saved here

___________

ml pipeline:
1. Load & Prepare Data
2. Vectorize
3. Train

result:
- 4. model
- 5. web service
